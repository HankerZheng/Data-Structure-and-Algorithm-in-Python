# Algorithm
# 1) Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices
#    included in shortest path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from source is
#    calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty.
# 2) Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all
#    distance values as INFINITE. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex
#    so that it is picked first.
# 3) While sptSet doesn't include all vertices
#   a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has minimum distance value.
#   b) Include u to sptSet.
#   c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance
#      values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v,
#      if sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less
#      than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.
