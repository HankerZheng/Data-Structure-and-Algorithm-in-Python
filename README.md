===
- Manacher Algorithm added
- There is also the dynamic programming algorithm and the O(1)-space algorithm to longest palindrome substring (LPS) problem
- Manacher Algorithm is an linear-time and linear-spaced algorithm to find the LPS.
- Test cases are randomly generated by `random.choice(char_set)`, where `char_set` only contain 5 different character and the length of each test string are set to 300
- The result of Manacher algorithm should be the same as the result from other LPS algorithms

===
- KMP algorithm added
- KMP is an O(n) time `strStr` algorithm even for worst cases
- Test cases are generated from the sample text in Wiki-pedia on [Knuth–Morris–Pratt_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm)
- The result of KMP algorithm should be the same as the result of normal `strStr` function

===
- Fenwick Tree added
- Fenwick Tree is also known as Binary Indexed Tree
- Fenwick Tree is used to calculate contiguous sum of given list. The sum_up operation, update operation would take O(log n) time on average
- Test cases are generated from `range(1, 1001)`
- According to the test, `fenwickTree.get_index(i)` should be equal to `i+1`, while `fenwickTree.query_sum(i,j)` should be equal to the contiguous sum from `i+1` to `j+1` inclusively
